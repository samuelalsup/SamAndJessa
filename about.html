We went to Trader Joes \nand got all of our favorite snacks, we \nwent to Avila Beach and had the time \nof our lives, and then we went to Chipotle \nand Ralphs to get food to prepare for \nthe best snuggle session ever! It was \nalso the first time that we did sexual \nthings, a day that I will remember \nfondly forever. I love you beautiful. "; 
          let m2 = "August 3, 2018. We went to the beach and took \nHuji pictures as we drove back near the reservoir.\nThen we adventurously drove up to \nTop of the World and took pictures of \nthe sunset together and enjoyed the perfect \nweather. I still love looking at the \npicture of you in front of the sunset, and \nthinking of how fun that sunny day \nwas. I love you beautiful!!! Can't \nwait to make more memories like that this summer!"; 
          let m3 = "July 22, 2018. One of the best days ever. The \nday that started to bring us together, a day \nI'll be forever thankful for. You picked \nme up in the Civic and then we listened \nto some bangers on our way to Mount Hermon.\nThen we skipped out on dinner at \nMount Hermon so that we could go to Seabright \nBeach. As we ran into the water, I \nrealized how much I loved you and \nI just felt so free. I love you so \nmuch Jessa and can't wait for Mount \nHermon this summer and to go to \nSeabright Beach again!!!"; 
          let m4 = "July 25, 2018. The day when we said 'I love you' \nto each other for the first time. We got \nto sleep in and then our families went \ntogether to Santa Cruz and then to the \nbeach. We got to go near the lighthouse and \nplayed Rex Orange County on the JBL \nat the beach. It was the perfect day and I \nremember telling you that we should \nplay Rex Orange County if we get \nmarried. We're definitely doing that. \nAnd then we snuggled on the deck, \nand it was truly the best thing \never. I love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m5 = "July 29, 2018. The day we first kissed, although \ntechnically it may have been July 30, since \nit might have been after midnight. \nNonetheless, it was one of the best days \never since I got to hang out with you in my \nroom for the first time after Mount \nHermon and we kissed. It was such a funny \nkiss, but I wouldn't have it any \nother way. I had butterflies after \nyou left, and I don't think I fell asleep \nfor at least an hour afterwards. \nI love you so much Jessa, and \nkissing you is one of my \nfavorite things in this world!!!"; 
          let m6 = "July 30, 2018. We went to the beach with the \nyouth group, and it was actually really fun. We \nplayed spikeball and worshipped and \nate at Duckies. You had your classic cobb \nsalad and I had my classic clam chowder \nin a bread bowl. We hung out with Chris \nand Colby and a bunch of others, and it \nwas also a hilarious night because \nit was the night that Chris kissed \nyou on the forehead. Hahaha. Even \ndespite that, it was a super fun night \nand I can't wait to do more /nbonfires on the beach with \nyou!!! I love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m7 = "August 1, 2018. Another beach day with you and \nme out at the Cayucos Pier, having the time of \nour lives. You wore my grey sweatshirt \nand looked absolutely beautiful, with \nyour curly hair flapping in the wind. Then \nwe hiked through the tidepools and \nclimbed on that big rock and kissed as the \nsun was setting. I remember it so \nwell and I don't think I'm ever \ngoing to forget it. I love you so much \nJessa and I love our beach days!!! \nCan't wait for more beautiful! "; 
          let m8 = "August 8, 2018. The day after my birthday, when \nwe celebrated at my house. We all got to hang \nout in my kitchen and you guys made \nice cream cakes. We watched the sunset at \nthe top of my yard and ate a good dinner \nwith my family. It was so fun to get \nto have you with me and my family in the \nsummertime, and I won't forget that \nday for a long time. I love you \nJessa!!!"; 
          let m9 = "August 5, 2018. I don't think anything else has \nto be said about this day. It's amazing because \nit's the day that my life changed \nfor the better.

I'm so lucky that I get \nto love you and be yours and that \nyou're all mine. I promise to treat \nyou like a princess for the rest \nof our lives! Love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m10 ="August 16, 2018. We went on a date into downtown \nPaso. Our fourth date I think it was. Hehe. We \ngot to throw the frisbee in the park \nand listen to that not very good band \nthat was playing in the gazebo. We laid on \nthe grass together and enjoyed our \nfinal days before you left for Pepperdine. \nIt was such a fun evening and it \njust reminds me of the chill last \ndays of summer we had and all the days \nthat we'll get this summer. Can't \nwait to go the Mexican or Thai \nplace with you again soon! \nLove you forever Jessa!!!"; 
          let m11 ="August 29, 2018. The day I came and surprised \nyou. I remember waiting for you to come out. I \nwas so excited. You looked so surprised \nand so beautiful when you came out. We \ngot to go to Sunlife and then the Malibu \nFarm Cafe on the pier and we just \nhad the best time before I had to go home. \nThat is seriously one of the most \nmemorable days of my life and it was \nso fun to see you in your (new at \nthe time) dorm. I love you Jessa and \nlove getting to spend time with \nyou in Malibu!!!"; 
          let m12 ="September 2, 2018. I got to see you at my mom's \nbirthday at Avila Beach! You came down for my \nmom's birthday and you surprised her \nand it was so fun!

I love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m13 ="September 15, 2018. The Jason Mraz concert. \nThough this wasn't a long time spent with each other, \nI chose this memory because of how \nmuch I missed you and the butterflies \nfeeling I got when I walked down the ramp of \nthe Santa Barbara Bowl and you \nwere standing at the bottom, looking incredibly \nbeautiful in your dress you \nwore for rush. Though we didn't have \nmuch time to hang out afterwards, it \nwas a memorable night because it was \nso satisfying and fun to see \nyou, even though we only \ngot to hang out for an hour or two. \nEven when you only come home for a \nday or I come and see you \nfor a day, it feels like a great memory \nbecause I'm with you! I love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m14 ="September 19, 2018. I met you in Avila at \nlunch time and we spent the afternoon swimming and \neating good snacks and then we watched \nthe sunset on the beach. Then we came \nback to my house and you stayed in my bed \nuntil morning. Probably not our best \nmove ever, but nonetheless an unforgettable \nday haha. I'll never forget how \nbeautiful the sunset was and you \nwere on this day. I love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m15 ="September 22, 2018. I got to come with your \nfamily to move Ryan in. We got to eat all together \non the Malibu Pier and we saw Bradley \nSteven Perry  haha.

It was super \nfun getting to hold your hand and \nexperience that fun church service \ntogether. I love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m17 ="October 13, 2018. Wave Weekend.

I love you Jessa!!!"; 
          let m18 ="November 16, 2018. We took a drive on Peachy \nCanyon and took pictures by all the trees and it \nwas gorgeous.
